# Ring Sizer

**An online ring sizer using javascript.**

Accurately determine your ring size online by using a standard size credit card and a ring that already fits. This library is made for [The7dayringproject](http://www.the7dayringproject.com/).


## Getting Started

To use the ring sizer, visit the [ring sizer] page on The7dayringproject. Using a physical credit card, resize the credit card on the screen until it matches the size of your card. Take a ring that already fits you and compare it against the blue circles. The circle with the diameter closest to your ring indicates your size!
